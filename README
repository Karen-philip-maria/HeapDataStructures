 Heaps - it is a complete binary tree data that satisfies the
 heap property.
 They are usually used to compare queues, where the smallest or
 the largest element is always at the root of the tree.


-Advantages of Heaps

It is efficient in insertion and deletion
Efficient priority queue
There is guaranteed access to max and min element
It is space efficiency
It has worst-case time complexity on heap-sort-algorithm 


-Disadvantages of Heaps

It lacks flexibility
It is not ideal for searching
It has no stable data structures
Less memory management since it error prone
